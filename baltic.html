    <p>This is the first show and release from Microscopic Suffering and the reason why MS exists. MS played in a band GOLY GRIM, and was asked if they were interested in playing a noise night at the Baltic Room in Seattle. At the time MS was just a duo. They decided to start an improv noise band as a side project, and said yes to the show. It was the start of something good. This first show consisted of them wearing a doctor and nurse costume. Seemed appropriate to be theatrical with the sounds they were producing. The first show went very well, and put them on the Seattle scene pretty quickly.  </p>
