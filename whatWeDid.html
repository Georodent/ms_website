    <p>Collaboration with Human Services. Recorded in Hampton, VA. Human Services and MS walk into a studio, pick up instruments and started recording. Not many words were exchanged before, during, or after. There are two versions of these recordings. HS released a CD that was collaborated with various musicians. MS got to play with them and this is what happened. Check out the Human Services mix. Other overdubs were recorded on the HS mix. MS mix is pretty raw and desolate.</p>
